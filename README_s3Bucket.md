I have an s3 bucket in aws services to dump backup data from Wordie. 


**Instructions to finish job**

### Steps to Configure AWS S3 and Credentials

1. **Create an IAM User for S3 Access**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - Search for "IAM" and click "Add users".
   - Choose a username (e.g., `batch-logger`) and select "Programmatic access".
   - Attach the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy for testing. For production, consider creating a custom policy with write-only permissions to the specific bucket.
   - Save the generated "Access key ID" and "Secret access key".

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Use one of the following methods to configure credentials:

   **Using AWS CLI**:
   - Install AWS CLI if not already installed.
   - Run `aws configure` and input your "Access key ID", "Secret access key", and default region.

   **Using Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your-region
   ```

3. **Update Your Python Script**:

   Make sure you're using `boto3` in your script:

   ```python
   import boto3

   def process_and_store_batch(batch):
       batch_json = json.dumps(batch, indent=4)
       batch_file_name = 'batched_interactions.json'
       with open(batch_file_name, 'w') as f:
           f.write(batch_json + '\n')

       s3 = boto3.client('s3')
       bucket_name = 'your-s3-bucket-name'
       s3_key = f'batch-logs/{datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")}_batched_interactions.json'
       
       try:
           s3.upload_file(batch_file_name, bucket_name, s3_key)
           app.logger.info(f'Uploaded to S3: {s3_key}')
       except Exception as e:
           app.logger.error(f'Error uploading to S3: {e}')
   ```

   Replace `'your-s3-bucket-name'` with your actual bucket name.

### Production Considerations:

- **IAM Policy**: Use restrictive IAM policies to grant the least privilege necessary.
- **Environment Variables**: Securely manage your AWS keys. Avoid hardcoding keys in code.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure error handling for network issues or failed uploads.

With these steps, your setup is ready for production, ensuring secure and efficient S3 integration.
