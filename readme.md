# Wordie: The Human-AI Interaction Research App  

**Wordie is a custom AI interface web app for Human-AI interaction research**  

The app is built on the chatPsych codebase [chatPsych](https://chatpsych.github.io)  
The app is hosted for demo purposes at [wordie.xyz](https://wordie-pilot.xyz)  

default login: 		prolific_id = [anything], password = music   
researcher login: 	username = wordie, password = laplace666$

**Summary of the core Elements of Wordie-AI Interface:**  

Wordie is designed to scrape a plethora of interaction data especially relevant to various human-AI interaction research.
It is scalable and easy to experimentally customise and condition participant groups. This interface aims to make interaction with
real-world AI systems more accessible. Integration with Qualtrics, Prolific, MTurk or other platforms for online sampling is easy.

The code is adaptable for various experimental manipulations. For example, manipulations that involve prompt engineering, API call parameters, 
AI model selection, communication modalities (audio/text), custom vector store retrieval, hardcoded experimental AI responses/prompts, and more. 

Summary of Wordie's core features:
1. **Framework:** Flask
2. **Production Server:** Gunicorn
3. **API Integration:** OpenAI, Anthropic, LLAMA, Gemini
4. **Data Files:**
   - interactions.json
   - interactions_backup.csv
5. **Data Attributes:**
   - user_id
   - prolific_id
   - temperature
   - model
   - messages (user, AI)
   - log probabilities (AI)
   - Relative Sequence log probability 
   - Relative Interaction log probability
   - token counts
   - timestamps
6. **Database:** users.db
    - The users.db is used for the apps functionality and not data collection or analyses. 
7. **Researcher Dashboard GUI**
8. **Production Server Integration:** AWS EC2 Instance
9. **Web Server:** Apache2
10. **SSL:** Certbot
11. **Experimental Setup:**
    - Participant conditioning via prolific ID, passwords 
    - Conditioning set using db passwords for survey integration
    - Easily modified Agents JSON directory for condition settings
12. **Performance Optimization:** 
    - Swap Space, standardised delays, cookie tracking for dynamics
13. **Log Data Collection:** 
    - interactions.json, interactions_backup.csv
14. **Aesthetics** 
    - Customised graphics, logos, and aesthetics
    - Full CSS and javascript dynamics drafted

## Updates, Notes & Message to Researchers

**Researcher Dashboard:**
The researcher dashboard GUI is still a work in progress.
Prospective updates will include:
                -> Some "general settings" to change models, selection of output as text/audio/audio&text.
                -> An editor for the second interaction data capture (command-prompt/moral action button).
                -> Some visuals and descriptive graphics for interaction data. 

**Message to other researchers**
- Please contact [me](https://oliverlack.com) if you want to collaborate/adapt the system for your purpose. Happy to help. 
- Instances cannot yet run multiple API scripts simultaneously. Make sure the API_Call() in wordie.py is set to the correct API script. If agent models do not correspond to the select API_Call(), they will not load. 
- Before deploying the app, if you want to set the passwords and conditions for your experiments manually, change the static_passwords vector in wordie.py.


**Extra info**
- Numbers labelling current AI agent conditions 1 = AI is guesser 2 = AI is giver.
- An instance with Wordie will total 3.7gb of volume storage before any data is logged. 



**PMC Study 1**
TODO List:
- Audio integration (Researcher dashboard selection panel)
- API Model selection reboot researcher dashboard
- Simple Survey Integration
- GithHub Readme files (local-deployment, deployment, updates, researcher_manual)
- chatPsych.org playground, source code

- Measures of unpredictability:
1. joint probability of sequence and interactions (iterated exponent of the summed logprobs)
2. prompt engineering score
3. Human Perception of unpredictability (survey)
4. zipf law score
